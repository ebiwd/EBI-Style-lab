Cause and effect. We write text and create page layotus to make things happen: download a PDF, submit data or to get the user to think of EMBL-EBI as great place. We use the [Content-Action Model (CAM)](https://work.allaboutken.com/posts/20180122-content-action-model.html) to help us understand and infer relationships.

<div class="callout table-of-contents"><h3>On this page</h3><p>Loading...</p></div>

### Why

The CAM is a method we utilise to:

1. Make a statement of what we seek to achieve
2. Document the thinking and actors involved
3. Track success over time and with metrics

### Where

Use this method on a series of web pages or ecosystem. For example a service might have a few models:

1. The homepage
  - A top layer model about how a user engages into the rest of the site.
2. An application side
  - How users submit a query, view results, download data, etc.
3. An "About" section
  - How users learn about the service, view news, engage with social media.

### How

The tool we use to make our Content-Action Models is currently a document template (more on that below) that asks about our goals from different — but interconected — angles: Mission, URLs, Goals, Target audience, Content, and Inward and outward paths.

1. Let us guide you
  - If this is your first time using the CAM we can help you understand how best to use it: [khawkins@ebi.ac.uk](mailto:khawkins@ebi.ac.uk) or [www-dev@ebi.ac.uk](mailto:www-dev@ebi.ac.uk)
2. Use the template
  - Use the below Google Doc as template and documentation for your Core Content Specifications.

### Future plans?

Working with the Web Content Committee, Communications, Training, Web Development and other teams, this model has been evolving since the end of 2016. Here is what we have planned for the next evolution:

1. Visualise the data we've collected.
  - Core Content Specifications share connections between models. We can use those connections to see a bird's eye view of   pathways between models and see which ecosystems are performing as expected.
2. Performance measurement
  - By looking at the documented content and associated goals, we can use tools like Google Analytics to measure more than time on page, and begin to measure real success.
3. A real database tool
  - Many parts of the Google Doc are a relational database and as such are a poor fit to be done by hand. We could build a better system on the web, once the model has fully stabilised (we should be nearly stable).
