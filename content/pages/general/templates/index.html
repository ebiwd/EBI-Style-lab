### About our visual brand

To ensure EMBL is clearly recognisable to the outside world, we encourage our staff to use consistent colours, fonts and heading styles in all presentations, posters, business cards, print publications, web pages and letters.

If you have an outreach role and would like to order business cards, please fill in the <a href="//intranet.ebi.ac.uk/outreach/business-cards">business card form</a>.

If you have questions about the <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/web/guidelines">Web Style guidelines</a>, contact the <a href="mailto:www-dev@ebi.ac.uk">Web Development team</a>.

### Logos and letterhead

#### Templates

To get the most out of these templates, please make sure you have the <a href="//intranet.ebi.ac.uk/outreach/fonts-and-icons">official EMBL-EBI fonts</a> installed on your machine. (We use <a href="//intranet.ebi.ac.uk/sites/intranet.ebi.ac.uk/files/content/outreach/Images/HelveticsNeueLTPro_fonts.zip">Helvetica Neue Pro</a> for headings and Minion Pro for body text.) Please contact the <a href="mailto:desktop@ebi.ac.uk">Desktop Team</a> if you need help with this.

The templates and logos presented here are for internal and external use. If you require these materials in a different format, please send a request to <a href="mailto:comms@ebi.ac.uk">External Relations</a>.

#### Document template

If you are writing a formal document representing EMBL-EBI, you may wish to use our document template.

This document has been set up with Styles, which take some of the work out of formatting headers and other elements.

Our <a href="//intranet.ebi.ac.uk/sites/intranet.ebi.ac.uk/files/content/outreach/Documents/EMBL-EBI_document_template_July_2013.docx">Word template</a> includes styles and embedded features like the logo and address. Your feedback on this template is of course welcome (e-mail <a href="mailto:comms@ebi.ac.uk">comms@ebi.ac.uk</a>).

<h4><a href="//intranet.ebi.ac.uk/sites/intranet.ebi.ac.uk/files/content/outreach/EMBL-EBI_letterhead_Aug_2013.docx">Letterhead</a></h4>

- First, save <a href="//intranet.ebi.ac.uk/sites/intranet.ebi.ac.uk/files/content/outreach/Documents/EMBL-EBI_letterhead_2016.docx">this EMBL-EBI letterhead</a> as a "template" in Microsoft Word.
- Our Letterhead and Document templates both include styles that you can apply to the body text, headings, etc. Styles are shortcuts for formatting, so we recommend you use them.
- For official letters, make sure the EMBL-EBI logo sits in the top right corner of the paper.
- EMBLâ€™s official names (in English, German and French) should appear in the bottom right corner, in the footer.
- To ensure that EMBL letters have a recognisable look, please do not alter the position of text blocks, font, font size or positioning and size of the logo and official names.

### EMBL fonts

EMBL uses <a href="//intranet.ebi.ac.uk/sites/intranet.ebi.ac.uk/files/content/outreach/Images/HelveticsNeueLTPro_fonts.zip">Helvetica Neue Pro</a> and Minion Pro fonts for print. <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/web/style/typography">EMBL-EBI's website also uses Verdana</a>.

If you cannot use Helvetica, Arial may be used.

For those keenly interested in fonts: Originally designed in 1959 by Max Miedinger, the Helvetica font was adapted by the D. Stempel AG company and put on the market in 1983 under the name of New Helvetica. It is available as a complete font family with 51 types and weights. Minion was originally designed as a traditional typeset font by American Robert Slimbach in 1992.

For continuous text we recommend 10-point Minion with a 12-point leading. (Leadings in MS Word are shown in the box underneath font size.)

#### Fonts in slide presentations

In slide presentations, the font size should never fall below 22 points, as it is very difficult to read smaller fonts comfortably.

### Brochures about EMBL-EBI

#### Perspectives on our organisation

In collaboration with our colleagues in the Office of Information and Public Affairs (OIPA) in Heidelberg, the External Relations team produces a number of publications throughout the year. Our goal in making these publications is to distribute them as widely as possible in order to raise awareness about our organisation. We warmly welcome you to take and distribute printed copies of these brochures, and to forward links to digital versions.

### Slide sets and slide template

#### Guidelines for use

EMBL is a well-known institute with an international reputation, and it is important that we ensure it is clearly recognisable to the outside world. All slide presentations, posters, business cards, print publications, web pages, letters and faxes should use specific colours and fonts so that we present a uniform design.

This slide template and sample presentations are provided for internal and external use, and are updated periodically. If you require these materials in a different format, please send a request to <a href="mailto:comms@ebi.ac.uk">External Relations</a>.

This slide template is created and maintained by Spencer Phillips in External Relations. Please <a href="mailto:comms@ebi.ac.uk">email the team</a> if you spot a mistake, or if you think this slide deck is missing something important.

#### Keynote slide template

#### EMBL-EBI overview slides

If you are looking to make a public presentation about EMBL-EBI, you're welcome to use the information we have collated in our Overview slides.

These slides are displayed in the Main and South Building Reception areas and contain the most up to date information about EMBL-EBI. The stats used in the presentation are released once a year after we publish our Annual Report and can be shared publicly.

We encourage you to use them if you are presenting to an audience who is new to EMBL-EBI. Just pick and choose which slides are right for your presentation. You can also use the graphics in your own slide presentation.

### Scientific poster templates

These poster templates are <strong>scalable</strong>, so you can resize it to A0, A1, A3, etc.

Fonts: See the <a href="//tsc.ebi.ac.uk/node/290">Logos and branding page</a> for tips on logos, colours and fonts. Briefly: use Helvetical Neue or Arial (not both) for headings and Minion for paragraph text.

#### Where to get your poster printed

If you are having your poster printed in <a href="https://helix.wtgc.org/groups/reprographics">Reprographics</a>, ask Mark to resize it for you. He might also recommend that you print on fabric, which travels well.

You might consider having it printed in Heidelberg, by our colleagues at <a href="mailto:photolab@embl.de">PhotoLab</a>. They will arrange shipment as well.

#### Spencer and Mary's Tips for Making a Good Poster

1. Put yourself in the viewer's shoes. What are they MOST interested in? How close will they get to read the poster?
1. Divide your content up into 'chunks', or paragraphs. Score each one: crucial, necessary and nice to have.
1. Make the 'crucial' chunks the most prominent. The biggest of these should be your 'elevator pitch': For (target user), who has (user need), (service name) is a (resource category) that (one key benefit). Unlike (competition), this service (unique differentiator).
1. Meditation: People often cannot read fonts smaller than 22 point on a poster. If you can't read the text from a metre away, it is not likely to be read by many people.
1. Consider carefully how much content you need to generate interest. Do you need those 'nice to haves'? How much of your methodology do you need to show?
1. What is the central image in your poster, and why? Do you need more imagery? Are your graphs helping tell a story? Are they really?
1. Put your poster together as best you can, and before you start to get snow-blind to the content, share it with someone in another team (e.g. <a href="mailto:comms@ebi.ac.uk">External Relations</a>) for some honest feedback.

### Business cards

#### Ordering your business card

If you're going to a conference or meeting and would like to order business cards, fill in the [business card request form](http://goo.gl/forms/BYafjl4x1f).

Your EMBL-EBI business card will be put together by External Relations and printed by an outside vendor.

You will see a proof of the card before it is printed.

If you do outreach as part of your responsibilities, the cost of the card will be covered by External Relations.

<p>Please be sure to have the approval of your GTL before you complete the order form. If you have any questions, <a href="mailto:comms@ebi.ac.uk">e-mail External Relations</a>.</p>

#### Sample business card

The business card is printed on two sides. The back can be printed in blue-green, or in white.
