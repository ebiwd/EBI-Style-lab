<h3 class="how-to-header">What are patterns?</h3>
{{#markdown}}

Patterns are:

- HTML, CSS, and JS snippets that work on EMBL-EBI project
- Lightly styled components
- Easy to extend or customize
- Common solutions to layout or component challenges that are not core to the Framework

Patterns are NOT:

- Templates
- Themes
- Overly stylized
- Code that does not integrate with EBI Visual Framework

In short: The intent of patterns are to solve common patterns, scaffold faster, and integrate with your existing styles right out of the box.

### How To Use a pattern

Patterns are easy to use in your projects whether you’re using a CSS version or the powerful ZURB Stack. Below, we’ve outlined how to get a pattern into your project in a snap and build faster.

<h4 id="copy" class="how-to-subheader">(Option A) Copy it</h4>

Like a pattern? You can copy the HTML and CSS/SCSS and JS (if applicable) from the pattern detail page. You’ll see a responsive preview and description at the top of the page. Below the preview you’ll find the code for the component.

The HTML, CSS, and JS toggles let you focus on one section at a time if you’d like.

<img src="{{root}}assets/img/images/top-section.png" class="" height="" width="" alt="">

You can copy the the code from each code container using the handy copy button.

<img src="{{root}}assets/img/images/copy-section.png" class="" height="" width="" alt="">

If you are using CSS vs SCSS, you can toggle to the compiled CSS using this handy toggle:

<img src="{{root}}assets/img/images/css-section.png" class="" height="" width="" alt="">

If you’re using the CSS version of Foundation, it’s best to add the CSS to your app.css file that is included with the downloaded Foundation CSS project. You can make any style overrides from there.

If you’re using the ZURB Stack Sass version, a custom SCSS partial is the best place to add the pattern’s SCSS. The JS can be added to app.js. But if you’re a fan of optimization, we suggest you use the Foundation CLI install to do all this automatically for you. It’s rad!

<h4 class="how-to-subheader" id="download-individual">(Option B) Download an individual pattern</h4>

You can can download the files needed for the pattern. Click the download button and you’ll get:

- Individual HTML files
- Individual CSS files for each
- Individual SCSS files in case you want to manually add them to a Sass project
- Individual JS files (if applicable)

<!-- <h4 class="how-to-subheader" id="download-kit" >(Option 4) Download a pattern Kit</h4>

Looking to start with a pattern kit? Kits are large collections of patterns that are matched to each other for a specific type of Site, App, or use case. To save you time over the copy/paste method of individual patterns, you can download a zip file of the kit. For each pattern, it will come with:

<ul>
- Individual HTML files
- Individual CSS files for each
- Individual SCSS files in case you want to manually add them to a Sass project
- Individual JS files (if applicable)
</ul>

Again, if you’re using the ZURB Stack, the Foundation CLI can do this for you. -->

<h4 class="how-to-subheader" id="dependencies" >Dependencies</h4>

Patterns are made to drop into any EBI Visual Framework project and work. Therefore Foundation is a dependency (needs it to work as expected). You'll also want to check you're using a corresponding and compatible version of the EBI Visual Framework.

</div> -->

All are welcome to contribute patterns. Submissions are made through GitHub, with pull requests — or they can be e-mailed to <a class="external "href="mailto:www-dev@ebi.ac.uk">www-dev@ebi.ac.uk</a>

You need to:
1. Clone or download the repo from https://github.com/ebiwd/EBI-Style-lab
2. Navigate to the repo
3. `npm install`
4. `bower install`
5. `npm start`
5. and `cd content/websites/patterns/`

This will start the build system and watch for changes. When you save a change, the browser preview will refresh automatically.

<h4 id="files" class="how-to-subheader">Submitting your pattern</h4>

There are just a few simple files needed to submit your pattern.

- **HTML:** Every pattern will need an HTML file to demonstrate the uniqueness of the component or layout.
- **SCSS:** You’ll add your custom styles in a SCSS file. You only need your additional styles as Foundation is already being imported for you. SCSS files accept CSS or SCSS so you can format it either way.
- **JS:** If your component uses custom JavaScript/jQuery you’ll create a JS file and add it there. Again, Foundation JS and jQuery are already included, so only your custom JS is needed if you used any.
- **Image:** A preview image of your pattern. This will give people context on what the pattern is! See suggestions for great preview images. The thumbnail should be in a <code>.png</code> format.
- **YML:** You’ll want to describe your pattern and submit your name. A Yaml file uses a <code>.yml</code> file extension and is where the pattern name, description, tags and more are stored.
- **Optional Layout HTML or SCSS:** The pattern should a stand-alone component that comes with no extra grid markup or containers. You can use an optional layout file to display the Blocks in a nicer way. <a href="#add-layout">See example below.</a>

You’ll find the <code>building-blocks</code> folder in the root directory of the patterns project. This is where all the patterns that get displayed on the site live.

<h4 id="banch" class="how-to-subheader">(Step 1) Create a New Branch:</h4>

Create a branch from which to submit your pattern from. This will allow you to submit a Pull Request when you’re done so that the Foundation team can review it, offer suggestions and merge it in.

In your terminal, checkout a new branch

`git checkout -b your-branch-name`


<h4 id="cli" class="how-to-subheader">(Step 2) Create a New, Unique Folder:</h4>

Create a new folder in the patterns folder. Name it the name of your pattern.

The name should contain the component or type of component it is. For example a card should have Card in the name or a sidebar layout should have Sidebar in the name.

Example: article-card

All your files in the folder will have the same root name

- article-card
  - article-card.html
  - article-card.scss
  - article-card.js
  - article-card.png
  - article-card.yml

<h4 id="add" class="how-to-subheader">(Step 3) Add your Block:</h4>

In your pattern component folder, create your <code>.html</code>, <code>.scss</code>, <code>.js</code> and <code>.yml</code> pages.

1. Create a HTML file
  - Example: article-card.html
  - Paste in your HTML
  - Save
1. Create a SCSS file
  - Example: article-card.scss
  - Paste in your SCSS or CSS
  - Save
1. Create an JS file (if applicable)
  - Example: article-card.js
  - Paste in your JS
  - Save
1. Create an YML file
  - Example: article-card.yml
  - Fill out your yml data
  - Save
  - Here is a .yml file template you can use: <a href="https://github.com/zurb/building-blocks/blob/master/building-block-sample.yml" target="_blank">Sample .yml file</a>
  - Make sure to add meaningful tags. <a href="#tag-details">See tag details below</a>.
1. Add your preview image
  - Example: article-card.png
  - Add the image to the <code>article-card</code> folder for this example.
  - <a href="#img-guide">See image guidelines</a>


</ol>

Tags are important for many reasons. They not only tell people about the patterns, but they also help people find others like it.

To make it easy, we put together a list of tags to use. You'll find the tag list here: <a href="http://zurb.us/2oND1JR" target="_blank">http://zurb.us/2oND1JR</a>

**That’s it!**

You can preview your new pattern on the homepage or go directly to it.

Example URL: http://localhost:8000/websites/patterns/article-card.html

<h4 id="add-layout" class="how-to-subheader">Optional Layout HTML or SCSS files.</h4>

If needed, patterns can have an optional layout file that helps you display your patterns preview in a certain way, repeat the component, or inside a container. For example, our Article Card is one single card that fills the width of the container it's in. In order to keep it to a certain width and to repeat it several times without adding a ton of markup to the Article Card itself, we'll add a <code>layout.html</code> file.

Create a <code>layout.html</code> file inside your patterns folder. So for our example, it will go in the <code>article-card</code> folder.

Example:

<img src="{{root}}assets/img/images/howto-layouthtml.png" class="" height="" width="" alt="image of layered states pattern">

Here we used a Block Grid and included our pattern 3 times, one for each column. You can use the Panini handlebars include like this or paste the HTML in.

You may need some CSS to ensure your pattern demo looks as good as possible. In that case you may create a <code>layout.scss</code> file to add custom styles.

Example:

<img src="{{root}}assets/img/images/howto-layoutscss.png" class="" height="" width="" alt="image of layered states pattern">

Note: adding a <code>layout.html</code> file will override the <code>containerClass</code> variable in your .yml file.

Looking good?


<h4 id="img-guide" class="how-to-subheader">Preview Images</h4>

In order to make sure all the preview images look consistant and represent your patterns well, we put together some guidelines for submitting a good preview image. These are the images that belong in the cards on the patterns search results.

Example of a good preview image:

<img src="{{root}}assets/img/images/howto-previewimgexample.png" class="" height="" width="" alt="image of good pattern previews">

Take a screenshot of your pattern with a background of <code>#E6E8EB</code>

<div class="float-right medium-7 large-5 callout columns">
<span class="label">Optional but nice to have</span>
<p><img src="{{root}}assets/img/images/howto-layeredbb.png" class="" height="" width="" alt="image of layered states pattern"></p>
<p>If your pattern has multiple states and would be hard to explain with just one image, take an image of the extra states and layer it on top of the first image so the important components of both are showing.</p>
</div>

In your favorite image editing program, make an artboard with dimensions of 370x255, and set the background to the color to <code>#E6E8EB</code>

Import the screenshot you took, and do your best to center it, while keeping it to about 80% of the width of the artboard


Export the image into the folder of your pattern, naming it the same name as the folder name.

<h4 class="how-to-subheader">(Step 4) Submit It!:</h4>

Now it’s time to submit your pattern. Make sure to add and commit your work. Then submit your Pull Request.

<h4 id="review" class="how-to-subheader">Review Process</h4>

Once you submit your pattern pull request, a member of the Foundation team will review it to add it in.

Things we’ll be looking for:

- An image
- The pattern meets class naming guidelines
- The pattern is responsive
- The <code>.yml</code> file has the proper tags and description.

Lastly, we merge in your Pull Request.
