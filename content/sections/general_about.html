### Where can I find icons?

The Web Guidelines Committee (<a href="mailto:wgc@ebi.ac.uk">wgc@ebi.ac.uk</a>) has put together five icon fonts, so there are many to choose from. You can access these fonts via the <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/web_guidelines/EBI-Icon-fonts/v1.1/">web guidelines</a>.

### Where can I find images to use on my web page?

The External Relations team (<a href="mailto:comms@ebi.ac.uk">comms@ebi.ac.uk</a>) is working on setting up a visual asset library to make it easier to share images throughout EMBL-EBI.

If you are looking for pictures of EMBL-EBI or of the Genome Campus, you can use any of the photos available on the <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Information/News/images.html">images page</a>.

You can find different versions of our logos on the [Logos and branding](https://tsc.ebi.ac.uk/article/logos) page.

If you require photos of a specific species (e.g., a silverback gorilla and no other), we encourage you to speak with the <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/services/teams/ensembl">Ensembl</a> team because they have already done a lot of work to secure many of these images.

### I'm stuck and need help designing or writing content for my web pages. Who do I contact?

Contact the <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/seqdb/confluence/display/WGC/">Web Guidelines Committee</a>, it's a large and diverse group of people who are happy to help.

If you have technical issue, <a href="https://github.com/ebiwd/EBI-Framework/issues/">post to the EBI Visual Framework issue queue</a>.
