## News and press releases

<h3>Who are these guidelines for?</h3>
<p>These are best practices for writing a news story, and can be used as a guide for writing short pieces for a general audience. This content was put together by the <a href="mailto:news@embl.de">EMBL-EBI and EMBL Heidelberg news teams</a>.</p>
<p>If you have a news story or would like help with writing a news-style piece for your web page or a blog post, please get in touch by emailing the <a href="mailto:news@embl.de">news team</a>, or a group of your writing colleagues in Hinxton, who are signed up to <a href="mailto:writers@ebi.ac.uk">writers@ebi.ac.uk</a>. If you would like to join this group, contact Mary in <a href="mailto:comms@ebi.ac.uk">External Relations</a>.</p>
<p>For a nit-picky list of EMBL style points, see <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/style-lab/general/writing/">Writing: EMBL style guide</a>.</p>
<h3>Press releases</h3>
<p>A press release is written to excite the interest of journalists, and is one of (hopefully) many inputs into a news article. It should be brief and exciting. The journalist will expect it to have a bias towards the scientist/institute, so it does not have to be exhustive. </p>
<p>The one thing all <strong>news</strong> stories have in common is that they are <strong>new</strong>: if you have an idea for a story, let the <a href="mailto:news@embl.de">news team</a> know as soon as possible! Here is what he or she will want to know:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Your elevator pitch: You have until the 9th floor (~30 seconds) to tell me what this story is about. Go!</li>
<li>Tell me why I, a non-scientist/engineer, should care about it.</li>
<li>Is there a potential application for this new finding? Or maybe an intrinsic fascination, something that changes the way we think about a subject?</li>
<li>Is your story about an article that will publish in a scientific journal? If so, which one? </li>
<li>When does it publish - or, more realistically - how will you find out when it will be published?</li>
<li>Who is the lead organisation?</li>
</ul>
<p>EMBL press releases have two potential <strong>audiences</strong>:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>the scientific, technical and medical press (e.g. GenomeWeb, Wired, New Scientist) - These are written for a scientifically literate audience, bearing in mind that the recipient may not be familiar with the topic in question.</li>
<li>the general media (e.g. the Guardian, Die Zeit, El Pais, La Monde) - These are sent out to a list of ~2000 international media contacts including newspapers, TV and radio stations throughout EMBL's member states as well as the STM press.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some examples of the kind of stories we write press releases about:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>breakthroughs in research and technology development (often these are based on scientific publications)</li>
<li>major new services and databases that address a need in the scientific community</li>
<li>new member states, partnerships, etc.</li>
<li>major new projects that address societal challenges.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do<strong> not</strong> generally issue press releases about:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>funding - unless it is for a major new project or infrastructure (e.g. ELIXIR, PETRA 3) and/or exceeds Â£5 million</li>
<li>changes in internal structure (unless we have a new DG or Head of outstation).</li>
</ul>
<h3>When do we release the story?</h3>
<p>The planned date and time of release should be established as soon as possible after a go-ahead decision has been made. The following should be taken into account:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>If the press release is based ona paper, it should be put out under embargo according to the stated rules of the journal. These will be sent to the authors by email. </li>
<li>News stories should be published online as soon as the paper is online, after the embargo defined by the journal has lifted.</li>
<li>The story should only be published if the person involved will be <strong>available to answer questions,</strong> whether that is by email/telephone or in person.</li>
<li>If the release is dependent on a contract being signed, or an award letter being issued, the writer must stay abreast of developments in order to determine when the story can be published.</li>
<li>If the story coincides with a major conference with a good press presence, consider how this could be exploited to increase coverage by the STM press.</li>
<li>Keep the news team informed to avoid possible clashes with other planned releases, and to link your story with others in the pipeline.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Approval procedure</h3>
<p>Once everyone involved in drafting a release is happy with it, it needs to be approved by:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Rolf Apweiler and Ewan Birney (EMBL-EBI), Iain Mattaj (EMBL)</li>
<li>Copy: <a href="mailto:news@embl.de">news@embl.de</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Distribution</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>General press releases are posted on all main EMBL and EMBL-EBI websites, including <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/news">www.ebi.ac.uk/about/news</a> and <a href="https://news.embl.de/">news.embl.de</a></li>
<li>Press releases that are only relevant to EMBL-EBI will only be posted on <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk">www.ebi.ac.uk</a> and relevant websites (e.g. resource websites, social media)</li>
<li>All press releases will be posted to the Eurekalert and Alphagalileo news wire services.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Writing style</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>If you are writing content for the web, we strongly recommend that you take the Writing for the Web course, which is run a couple of times a year and is taught by usability expert Caroline Jarrett. These are coordinated by the General Training and Development Programme - Our receptionists will send around an email when these courses have been scheduled.</li>
<li>The language of your story must be suitable for an international audience, which includes a significant proportion of non-native English speakers.</li>
<li>The hardest part of writing your story is sometimes coming up with one central analogy so that people who are not specialists in your area can easily identify with your central idea.</li>
<li>Take special care with analogies, though, because they do not always readily cross cultural or language barriers.</li>
<li>Put the most important information first, rather than starting with background information. Your text needs to tell an appealing, well-rounded story but the relevance and impact of the news should be stressed.</li>
<li>The ideal length for a press release - and indeed most short articles on the web - is around 350 words. Sounds easy, right? It might not be! It can be hard to cut back your text without cutting the 'meat' away from the story.</li>
<li>Insert a heading before each paragraph. These are crucial for people who read quickly - make sure that the headings convey they key point in the paragraph. You may decide to drop some of these headings in the end, but they will help you outline and edit.</li>
<li>Always, always have someone read over your story and give feedback. The ideal editor will not know much about your area of speciality.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Questions to ask as you write</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Who are you writing for?</li>
<li>Where, when and why will people use what you've written?</li>
<li>How will they use it?</li>
<li>What are you trying to achieve?</li>
<li>Is this paragraph strictly helpful/needed, or would they fit better with another story?</li>
<li><em>If</em> comes before <em>then</em> - are you presenting ideas in the right order?</li>
</ul>
